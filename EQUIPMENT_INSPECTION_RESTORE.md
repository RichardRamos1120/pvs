# Equipment Inspection Feature - Restore Instructions

## Status: TEMPORARILY DISABLED
**Date Disabled:** 2025-08-22
**Reason:** Per boss request - feature not currently needed but may be re-enabled later

## How to Re-Enable Equipment Inspection Feature

Follow these 3 simple steps to restore the Equipment Inspection feature:

### Step 1: Re-enable the Component Import
**File:** `src/App.tsx` (Line ~15)

Find this comment block:
```javascript
// ========== EQUIPMENT INSPECTION FEATURE - TEMPORARILY DISABLED ==========
// TO RE-ENABLE: Uncomment the import below (Step 1 of 3)
// import EquipmentInspection from './components/EquipmentInspection';
```

Uncomment the import line:
```javascript
import EquipmentInspection from './components/EquipmentInspection';
```

### Step 2: Restore the Route
**File:** `src/App.tsx` (Lines ~2577-2592)

Find this section and follow the instructions in the comments:
1. Delete or comment out the redirect route
2. Uncomment the original ProtectedRoute block

Change from:
```javascript
<Route path="/equipment-inspection" element={
  <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />
} />
```

To:
```javascript
<Route path="/equipment-inspection" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <EquipmentInspection />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### Step 3: Restore Navigation Links
**File:** `src/components/Layout.tsx`

#### Mobile Menu (Line ~395)
Find and uncomment the mobile menu link:
```javascript
{/* ========== MOBILE MENU: EQUIPMENT INSPECTION LINK - DISABLED ==========
    TO RE-ENABLE: Uncomment the <a> tag below (Step 1 of 2 for navigation)
```

#### Desktop Navigation (Line ~501)  
Find and uncomment the desktop navigation link:
```javascript
{/* ========== DESKTOP NAV: EQUIPMENT INSPECTION LINK - DISABLED ==========
    TO RE-ENABLE: Uncomment the <a> tag below (Step 2 of 2 for navigation)
```

## Quick Verification Checklist
After re-enabling, verify:
- [ ] Component import is uncommented in App.tsx
- [ ] Route is using ProtectedRoute (not redirect) in App.tsx
- [ ] Mobile menu link is visible in Layout.tsx
- [ ] Desktop navigation link is visible in Layout.tsx
- [ ] `/equipment-inspection` URL loads the correct page
- [ ] Navigation links appear in both mobile and desktop views

## Files Modified
1. `src/App.tsx` - Import and Route
2. `src/components/Layout.tsx` - Navigation Links
3. `src/components/EquipmentInspection.tsx` - No changes (component intact)

## Notes
- The EquipmentInspection component itself was NOT modified or deleted
- All functionality remains intact, just the access is disabled
- Database collections and Firebase operations remain unchanged
