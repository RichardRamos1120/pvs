# EmailJS Integration Troubleshooting

## Current Error Analysis

We're receiving a 404 "Account not found" error when attempting to use EmailJS. The important information:

- The request is correctly hitting the EmailJS API endpoint: `https://api.emailjs.com/api/v1.0/email/send`
- The parameters are being correctly formatted and sent
- The response is: `{status: 404, text: 'Account not found'}`

## Likely Causes

1. **Invalid or Expired Public Key**: The current public key `V-Mwr4x_iu6FVMCpB` may be invalid or expired.

2. **Service ID Mismatch**: The service ID `service_2umfd2m` may not exist or may not be accessible with the current public key.

3. **Account Limitations**: The EmailJS account may have usage limitations or might be inactive.

4. **Template ID Issue**: The template ID `contact_form` might not exist in the account.

## Verification Steps

1. **Check EmailJS Dashboard**:
   - Log in to your EmailJS account at [emailjs.com](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin)
   - Verify the account is active and in good standing
   - Check the remaining email quota

2. **Verify API Keys**:
   - Go to Integration section in EmailJS dashboard
   - Confirm the public key is correct
   - If needed, generate a new API key

3. **Verify Services**:
   - Go to Email Services section
   - Confirm that `service_2umfd2m` exists
   - Check if it's connected properly to your email provider

4. **Verify Templates**:
   - Go to Email Templates section
   - Check if `contact_form` template exists
   - Verify the template parameters match what we're sending

## Next Steps

1. **Generate a New API Key**:
   - Go to EmailJS dashboard > Integration
   - Create a new API key
   - Replace the current one in the code

2. **Create a New Service**:
   - If the current service isn't working, create a new one
   - Use Gmail, Outlook, or another personal email account for testing

3. **Create a Custom Template**:
   - Create a new template specifically for GAR assessments
   - Include all the necessary fields
   - Update the code to use the new template ID

## Important Note

If you're using a free EmailJS account, there are limitations:
- 200 emails per month
- 2 email services
- 3 email templates

Consider upgrading if you'll be sending a lot of notifications.
