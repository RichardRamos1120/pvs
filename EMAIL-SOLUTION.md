# Email Notification System for GAR Assessments

## Current Status

The current implementation has encountered an issue with the EmailJS account configuration. The error `Account not found` (404) indicates that the EmailJS account may not be properly set up, or the public key/service ID is incorrect.

## Explanation

EmailJS requires a correctly configured account with:
1. A verified email service
2. A proper template set up
3. A valid public key

It appears that while we've set up the code correctly, there might be an issue with the EmailJS account configuration or verification.

## Temporary Solution

I've modified the `emailService.js` file to:

1. Acknowledge the EmailJS account issue
2. Simulate email sending (for now)
3. Provide detailed console logs for debugging
4. Alert the user when an assessment is published

## Permanent Solutions (Choose One)

### 1. Fix EmailJS Account

To properly set up EmailJS:

1. Go to [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com/) and sign in
2. Verify your email and complete account setup
3. Create a new email service (or fix the existing one)
4. Create a template or use the default contact form
5. Get your correct public key from the account settings

Then update the code with the correct values:
```javascript
const SERVICE_ID = 'your_correct_service_id';
const TEMPLATE_ID = 'your_template_id';
const USER_ID = 'your_public_key';
```

### 2. Use a Server-Side Solution

For a more robust solution, implement emails on the server side:

1. Create a Firebase Cloud Function (requires Blaze plan)
```javascript
exports.sendEmail = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  // Send email using nodemailer with your MailerSend credentials
});
```

2. Call this function from your client code when an assessment is published

### 3. Use a Different Email Service

Consider other email services with free tiers that can be used from client-side code:

- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) (requires server key to be secure)
- [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) (requires server key to be secure)
- [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) (has a free tier and is simple to use)

## Next Steps

1. Check your EmailJS account configuration
2. Verify the service ID, template ID, and public key
3. Test the email sending using the test utility
4. Update the code with the correct values

## Testing

To test if EmailJS is properly configured:

1. Create a simple HTML file with the EmailJS library
2. Use your service ID, template ID, and public key
3. Send a test email
4. Check the console for any errors

## Note on Client-Side Email

Client-side email solutions like EmailJS have limitations:
- Email credentials are exposed in client-side code
- They rely on third-party services
- They may have usage limits (EmailJS free tier: 200 emails/month)

For a production application, consider implementing a server-side email solution for better security and reliability.
